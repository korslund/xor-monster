/* This is a "meta" test script. It is executed like any other test
   script when you run testy, but it accesses the Testy API itself to
   add additional tests to the queue.

   The tests added here test the parser only. The output is the raw
   HUC output from the parser, in JSON format. The scripts are not
   further compiled and executed.

   The test set includes all the normal tests (this file included),
   pluss all the files in the parser/ subdirectory. Output is written
   to a separate subdir as specified below.

   NOTE: None of the libraries, APIs or functions used here actually
   exist; this is pure top-down design. This file is expected to be
   adjusted later as the real APIs are implemented.

   "compile-and-execute" behavior. We only want to parse files and
   spit out the HUC, in JSON format.
